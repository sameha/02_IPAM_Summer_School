    "For this tutorial, we'll be using the [Street View House Number dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/). SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object recognition algorithms with minimal requirement on data preprocessing and formatting. It can be seen as similar in flavor to MNIST (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates an order of magnitude more labeled data (over 600,000 digit images) and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview of the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 classes, 1 for each digit. Digit '1' has label 1, '9' has label 9 and '0' has label 10.\n",
    "- 73257 digits for training, 26032 digits for testing, and 531131 additional, somewhat less difficult samples, to use as extra training data\n",
    "- Comes in two formats:\n",
    "    * Original images with character level bounding boxes.\n",
    "    * MNIST-like 32-by-32 images centered around a single character (many of the images do contain some distractors at the sides).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the second format. In terms of dimensionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the inputs (images) are 3x32x32\n",

    "$$ y^n = Wx^n+b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the nn package, describing ConvNets, MLPs and other forms of sequential trainable models is really easy. All we have to do is create a top-level wrapper, which, as for the logistic regression, is going to be a sequential module, and then append modules into it. Implementing a simple linear model is therefore trivial:\n",

    "\n",
    "Compared to the linear regression model, the 2-layer neural network can learn arbitrary non-linear mappings between its inputs and outputs. In practice, it can be quite hard to train fully-connected MLPs to classify natural images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional Networks are a particular form of MLP, which was tailored to efficiently learn to classify images. Convolutional Networks are trainable architectures composed of multiple stages. The input and output of each stage are sets of arrays called feature maps. For example, if the input is a color image, each feature map would be a 2D array containing a color channel of the input image (for an audio input each feature map would be a 1D array, and for a video or volumetric image, it would be a 3D array). At the output, each feature map represents a particular feature extracted at all locations on the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage is composed of three layers: a **filter bank layer**, a **non-linearity layer**, and a **feature pooling layer**. A typical ConvNet is composed of one, two or three such 3-layer stages, followed by a **classification module**. Each layer type is now described for the case of image recognition.\n",
    "![Convolutional Networds](./2_supervised_img1_convnet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Trainable hierarchical vision models, and more generally image processing algorithms are usually expressed as sequences of operations or transformations. They can be well described by a modular approach, in which each module processes an input image bank and produces a new bank. The figure above is a nice graphical illustration of this approach. Each module requires the previous bank to be fully (or at least partially) available before computing its output. This causality prevents simple parallelism to be implemented across modules. However parallelism can easily be introduced within a module, and at several levels, depending on the kind of underlying operations. These forms of parallelism are exploited in Torch7.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical ConvNets rely on a few basic modules:\n",
    "* **Filter bank layer**: the input is a 3D array with n1 2D feature maps of size n2 x n3. Each component is denoted $x_{ijk}$, and each feature map is denoted xi. The output is also a 3D array, y composed of m1 feature maps of size m2 x m3. A trainable filter (kernel) $k_{ij}$ in the filter bank has size l1 x l2 and connects input feature map x to output feature map $y_j$. The module computes $y_j = b_j + i_{kij} * x_i$ where $*$ is the 2D discrete convolution operator and $b_j$ is a trainable bias parameter. Each filter detects a particular feature at every location on the input. Hence spatially translating the input of a feature detection layer will translate the output but leave it otherwise unchanged.\n",
    "* **Non-Linearity Layer**: In traditional ConvNets this simply consists in a pointwise tanh() sigmoid function applied to each site (ijk). However, recent implementations have used more sophisticated non-linearities. A useful one for natural image recognition is the rectified sigmoid Rabs: $|g_i.tanh()|$ where $g_i$ is a trainable gain parameter. The rectified sigmoid is sometimes followed by a subtractive and divisive local normalization N, which enforces local competition between adjacent features in a feature map, and between features at the same spatial location.\n",
    "* **Feature Pooling Layer**: This layer treats each feature map separately. In its simplest instance, it computes the average values over a neighborhood in each feature map. Recent work has shown that more selective poolings, based on the LP-norm, tend to work best, with P=2, or P=inf (also known as max pooling). The neighborhoods are stepped by a stride larger than 1 (but smaller than or equal the pooling neighborhood). This results in a reduced-resolution output feature map which is robust to small variations in the location of features in the previous layer. The average operation is sometimes replaced by a max PM. Traditional ConvNets use a pointwise tanh() after the pooling layer, but more recent models do not. Some ConvNets dispense with the separate pooling layer entirely, but use strides larger than one in the filter bank layer to reduce the resolution. In some recent versions of ConvNets, the pooling also pools similar feature at the same location, in addition to the same feature at nearby locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of comments about the model that we are going to use:\n",
    "* the input has 3 feature maps, each 32x32 pixels. It is the convention for all nn.Spatial* layers to work on 3D arrays, with the first dimension indexing different features (here normalized YUV), and the next two dimensions indexing the height and width of the image/map.\n",
    "* the fist layer applies 16 filters to the input map, each being 5x5. The receptive field of this first layer is 5x5, and the maps produced by it are therefore 16x28x28. This linear transform is then followed by a non-linearity (tanh), and an L2-pooling function, which pools regions of size 2x2, and uses a stride of 2x2. The result of that operation is a 16x14x14 array, which represents a 14x14 map of 16-dimensional feature vectors. The receptive field of each unit at this stage is 7x7.\n",
    "* the second layer is very much analogous to the first, except that now the 16-dim feature maps are projected into 256- dim maps, with a fully-connected connection table: each unit in the output array is influenced by a 4x5x5 neighborhood of features in the previous layer. That layer has therefore 4x256x5x5 trainable kernel weights (and 256 biases). The result of the complete layer (conv+pooling) is a 256x5x5 array.\n",
    "* at this stage, the 5x5 array of 256-dimensional feature vectors is flattened into a 6400-dimensional vector, which we feed to a two-layer neural net. The final prediction (10-dimensional distribution over classes) is influenced by a 32x32 neighborhood of input variables (YUV pixels).\n",
    "* recent work (Jarret et al.) has demonstrated the advantage of locally normalizing sets of internal features, at each stage of the model. The use of smoother pooling functions, such as the L2 norm for instance instead of the harsher max-pooling, has also been shown to yield better generalization (Sermanet et al.). We use these two ingredients in this model.\n",
    "* one other remark: it is typically not a good idea to use fully connected layers, in internal layers. In general, favoring large numbers of features (over-completeness) over density of connections helps achieve better results (empirical evidence of this was reported in several papers, as in Hadsell et al.). The SpatialConvolutionMap module accepts tables of connectivities (maps) that allows one to create arbitrarily sparse connections between two layers. A couple of standard maps/tables are provided in nn.tables.\n",

    "## Step 3: Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a model, we need to define a loss function to be minimized, across the entire training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ L = \\sum_n l(y^n,t^n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest loss functions we can minimize is the **mean-square error** between the predictions (outputs of the model), and the groundtruth labels, across the entire dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l(y^n,t^n) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i (y_i^n - t_i^n)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in Torch:\n",
    "```torch\n",
    "criterion = nn.MSECriterion()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE loss is typically not a good one for classification, as it forces the model to exactly predict the values imposed by the targets (labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, a more commonly used, probabilistic objective is the **negative log-likelihood**. To minimize a negative log-likelihood, we first need to turn the predictions of our models into properly normalized log-probabilities. For the linear model, this is achieved by feeding the output units into a softmax function, which turns the linear regression into a logistic regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(Y=i|x^n,W,b) = \\text{softmax}(Wx^n+be) $$ \n",
    "$$ P(Y=i|x^n,W,b) = \\frac{ e^{Wx_i^n+b} }{ \\sum_j e^{Wx_j^n+b} } $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we're interested in classification, the final prediction is then achieved by taking the argmax of this distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y^n = \\arg\\max_i P(Y=i|x^n,W,b) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "in which case the ouput y is a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, the output of any model can be turned into normalized log-probabilities, by stacking a softmax function on top. So given any of the models defined above, we can simply do:\n",
    "```torch\n",
    "model:add( nn.LogSoftMax() )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to maximize the likelihood of the correct (target) class, for each sample in the dataset. This is equivalent to minimizing the **negative log-likelihood (NLL)**, or minimizing the cross-entropy between the predictions of our model and the targets (training data). Mathematically, the per-sample loss can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ l(x^n,t^n) = -\\log(P(Y=t^n|x^n,W,b)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that our model already produces log-probabilities (thanks to the softmax), the loss is quite straightforward to estimate. In Torch, we use the ClassNLLCriterion, which expects its input as being a vector of log-probabilities, and the target as being an integer pointing to the correct class:\n",
    "```torch\n",
    "criterion = nn.ClassNLLCriterion()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, another type of classification loss is the **multi-class margin loss**, which is closer to the well-known SVM loss. This loss function doesn't require normalized outputs, and can be implemented like this:\n",
    "```torch\n",
    "criterion = nn.MultiMarginCriterion()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin loss typically works on par with the negative log-likelihood. I haven't tested this thoroughly, so it's time for more exercises.\n"

    "\n",
    "We now have some training data, a model to train, and a loss function to minimize. We define a training procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very important aspect about supervised training of non-linear models (ConvNets and MLPs) is the fact that the optimization problem is not convex anymore. This reinforces the need for a stochastic estimation of gradients, which have shown to produce much better generalization results for several problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how the optimization algorithm can be easily set to either L-BFGS, CG, SGD or ASGD. In practice, it's very important to start with a few epochs of pure SGD, before switching to L-BFGS or ASGD (if switching at all). The intuition for that is related to the non-convex nature of the problem: at the very beginning of training (random initialization), the landscape might be highly non-convex, and no assumption should be made about the shape of the energy function. Often, SGD is the best we can do. Later on, batch methods (L-BFGS, CG) can be used more safely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, in the case of large convex problems, stochasticity is also very important, as it allows much faster (rough) convergence. Several works have explored these techniques, in particular, this recent paper from Byrd/Nocedal, and work on pure stochastic gradient descent by Bottou.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is our full training function, which demonstrates that you can switch the optimization you're using at runtime (if you want to), and also modify the batch size you're using at run time. You can do all these things because we create the evaluation closure each time we create a new batch. If the batch size is 1, then the method is purely stochastic. If the batch size is set to the complete dataset, then the method is a pure batch method."
